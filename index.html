        Welcome to my website! My name is Lawrence Abu-Hammour and I'm a member of the great class of 2019 at Dartmouth College. I'm an Engineering Sciences major concentrating
        in Electromechanical Engineering and I'm also an American History major modified with Arabic studies focusing on the period before 1865. I have always been fascinated with
        the world of design and engineering ever since I was a kid and I've always had a love for History because of how fun it can be to learn the story of how people lived and continue
        to live today. I'm from the Bogey-Down Bronx in the great New York City (see picture above and see map below). It is my home and it will always be my home. One day, I plan to use
        the skills that I learn at Dartmouth in Engineering or Design or even in History to give back to the community that raised me and help to build up the next generation of Bronxites
        ready to take on the world and "get out" of the Bronx.
<br>
<br>
        I have taken a good amount of courses in the Engineering department including ENGS 20 which was my very first programming experience which provided my love of learning to code and creating
        and designing some really cool stuff (Check out my <a href="https://github.com/LawrenceAbuHammour" style = "color: blue">Github</a>). Through this class during my freshman spring, I learned valuable programming skills in C and MATLAB which
        is heavily used in the Engineering and Scientific Community. It has become my most treasured engineering skill. From there, I jumped off and learned HTML/CSS the summer after my freshman year and eventually began my
        self-study program in various languages including SQL and Python. I have also been hopping onto the Javascript, Java, and C++ trains slowly but surely. Eventually, I plan to learn those languages and improve my Python
        skills. Udemy has been an excellent resource in my coding adventures and I hope to continue to learn more code through the coming years.
<br>
<br>
        I have even taken some of my coding skills into practice. I am currently a research assistant for Professor James LaBelle at the Wilder Physics Department at Dartmouth. The focus of our research is to identify the reason
        behind a mysterious "gap" that occurs during Medium-Frequency Burst events and my tool of choice is the MATLAB scripting language as it provides an excellent imaging toolbox that fits our purpose and provides exactly what
        we need when trying to identify these patterns. I also dabble in improving my CAD skills through Solidworks or AutoCAD which are the main tools used at Thayer and Engineering Firms and Companies for 3D modeling and finite element
        analysis. (See <a href="EngsPort.html" style = "color: blue">Engineering Portfolio</a> for more details on my engineering and research work).
<br>
<br>
        Just like at the Thayer School of Engineering, I love working in teams and groups because I believe that in Engineering and in Design, it is the best way to get things done. It is quite honestly my favorite thing
        about Engineering at Dartmouth. It's a social experience and a very collaborative, professional experience.
